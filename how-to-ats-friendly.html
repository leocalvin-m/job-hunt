  <!-- Understanding ATS -->
  <div class="content-section">
    <h5 class="subheading">Understanding ATS</h5>
    <p>Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) are utilized by many employers to process job applications more efficiently. These systems filter resumes by searching for keywords, skills, former employers, years of experience, schools attended, and specific sections. Understanding how these systems work is crucial to optimize your resume accordingly.</p>

    <h5 class="subheading">Key Strategies for an ATS-Friendly Resume</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simple Formatting:</strong> Use a clean, straightforward format with clear headings to ensure ATS can easily read your resume.</li>
      <li><strong>Keyword Optimization:</strong> Include keywords and phrases from the job description that match your skills and experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Standard Headings:</strong> Stick to conventional resume headings like 'Experience', 'Education', and 'Skills' to avoid confusion.</li>
      <li><strong>Readable Fonts:</strong> Use ATS-friendly fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Images and Graphics:</strong> Text within images cannot be read by ATS, so keep your resume text-based.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Bullet Points:</strong> Bullet points can help organize information and make it easier for both ATS and human eyes to read.</li>
      <li><strong>Spell Out Abbreviations:</strong> Write out abbreviations at least once to ensure ATS recognizes the terms.</li>
      <li><strong>File Format:</strong> Save your resume as a Word document (.docx) or a PDF to ensure it's ATS-friendly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Professional Summary:</strong> Begin with a concise summary that highlights your career achievements and relevant skills. Incorporate keywords from the job description.</p>
    <p><strong>Work Experience:</strong> List your experience in reverse-chronological order. Use bullet points to describe your responsibilities and accomplishments, quantifying results whenever possible.</p>
    <p><strong>Education:</strong> Include the degree obtained, the institution's name, and your graduation year. Relevant coursework, certifications, or honors can also be listed here.</p>
    <p><strong>Skills Section:</strong> Clearly list technical skills, software proficiency, languages, and any other abilities relevant to the job. Match the job description's language.</p>
