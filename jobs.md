At Uber, our mission is to help people go anywhere and get anything. Much of the functionality to find places to go and items to get is powered by the search platform built and managed by the SIA team. Our search platform provides customized search and discovery features for Rider and Driver Maps, Uber Eats, Groceries, Freight, and many such products and systems across Uber.  

  

As part of the SIA search platform team, you will design, build, and manage highly scalable algorithms and distributed systems to power search functionality for Uber's core business use-cases.

* Ensure the independent prioritization and delivery of high-quality features.
* Identifying potential problems and resolving application performance bottlenecks.
* Publishing application on Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
* Designing and implementing application updates.

**Prerequisites:**

* Experience in development of Android/iOS applications and have deployed them on Google Play/App Store.
* In depth understanding of Object-Oriented programming languages like Java and C++.
* Experience in the Flutter framework.
* Experience in Dart programming, developing and integration of Rest APIs, GetX state management, Firebase Cloud Messaging API, working with Map APIs, Caching Data using Hive and integration of payment gateways.
